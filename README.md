# Movie Analyzer ðŸŽ¬


A Python project to analyze IMDb ratings and genres of user-selected movies, displaying insights through visualizations.

## Features
- **User-Defined Movies**: Allows users to input their favorite movie titles.
- **Average Rating Calculation**: Computes the average IMDb rating of selected movies.
- **Genre Distribution**: Analyzes genres across all selected movies.
- **Top 5 Movies**: Displays the highest-rated movies in a bar chart.
- **Visualizations**: Provides graphical insights through genre distribution (pie chart) and top ratings (bar chart).
